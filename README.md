## Repository structure

The repository is organized using the following structure:

- data............. folder containing intake distributions and other key data
- code............. folder containing code to fit, describe, and compare intake distributions
- figures.......... folder containing figures for the manuscript
- tables........... folder containing tables for the manuscript

Please email Simone Passarelli (spassarelli@g.harvard.edu) if you have any questions about the paper and Chris Free (cfree14@gmail.com) if you have any questions about using the data, code, and/or repository.


## The "nutriR" R package

This paper and repository leverages functions for analyzing and using habitual intake distributions provided in the "nutriR" R package, which is available on GitHub here: https://github.com/cfree14/nutriR

The package includes functions to:

- Extract subnational intake distributions of interest: `?get_dists`
- Plot subnational intake distributions of interest: `?plot_dists`
- Generate subnational intake distributions for independent plotting: `?generate_dists`
- Shift subnational intake distributions of interest: `?shift_dists`
- Calculate summary exposure values (SEVs; a.k.a., nutrient deficiencies): `?sev`
- Calculate the mean of intake distributions: `?mean_dist`
- Calculate the coefficient of variation (CV) and variance of intake distributions: `?cv`, `?variance`
- Calculate the skewness and kurtosis of intake distributions: `?skewness`, `?kurtosis`
- Calculate percent overlap (Bhattacharyya coefficient) between intake distributions: `?overlap`

It also includes the habitual intake distributions documented in this paper as well as other important human nutrition datasets.
